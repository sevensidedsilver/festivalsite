      <p>Rhapsody takes over place four days and three nights.</p>
      <p>Event participants camp alone or organized into theme camps.</p>
      <p>This event ignites innovative creativity and self expression.</p>
      <p>It encorporates principles such as self reliance and civic responsibility.</p>

      <p>Fire performers, musicians, and artists alike call Rhapsody home.</p>
      <p>This is not a party. It is not a concert. </p>
      <p>Rhapsody celebrates shared values, art, and good for all.</p>
      <p>It does so in a fashion you haven't experienced anything like before.</p>

        <p>At Rhapsody, anyone can be the headliner.</br>
          Whether you DJ, sculpt, paint, or juggle, everything comes together</br>
          into a unorchestrated symphony of excellence. </br></p>

        <p>A "main stage" doesn't happen at this event.</br>
            Anyone is welcomed to set up and perform - coordinate with other </br>
            participants to establish different areas and make it work!</br></p>

        <p>We strongly encourage you to participate in the event any way you can.</br>
            This idea gets expressed through a community principle fondly </br>
            known as "radical participation".</br></p>

        <p>In other words, the event's success results from everyone's actions.</br>
            So bring your music, bring your nerf guns, bring your paint. </br>
            Whatever you do to express yourself, it's welcomed and encouraged here.</br></p>
